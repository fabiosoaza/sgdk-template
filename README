Introduction
------------

Regen is an emulator which can emulate the following systems with very high
accuracy:

* Sega Genesis/MegaDrive.

* Sega Master System, GameGear, SG-1000, SC-3000.

It also contains many other useful features and stuff :) .

The emulation of 8-bit consoles is currently not available in the Linux port.
You can get the latest version of Regen from:

Forums  : http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=15

Latest betas are only posted on the forum boards.


Requirements
------------

Processor: At least a Pentium III
RAM      : At least 128 MB.
Graphics : Anything should work, though cards with hardware acceleration are
           HIGHLY recommended.
Sound    : Anything supported by Linux should work.
Input    : Anything supported by Linux should work (including joypads/gamepads).

OS and Libraries:
Regen/GTK+ was developed on Fedora Core 7.
Regen/GTK+ requires GTK+ >= 2.10 and its dependencies.
Regen/GTK+ requires SDL  >= 1.2.11

There are other dependencies as well but I don't know how to find them :) .
But hopefully it will work out. Just double-click the damn thing and if it
doesn't work, report it.


Important Usage Instructions
----------------------------

* Regen/GTK+ stores everything in "~/.regen". By everything, I mean, the
  configuration settings, screen shots, quick save/load states, WAV logs, SRAM
  etc..

* Chaging the "Video Driver" requires a restart. Changing the video driver to
  SDL doesn't work that way. To set the video driver to SDL do the following:

  		1) Change Video driver to Software.
  		2) Restart the emulator.
  		3) Change Video driver to SDL.
  		4) Restart the emulator.

* Changing the sound driver also requires a restart to take effect.

* By default, Regen/GTK+ starts up in a mode whereby it can work on almost any
  PC. Though these settings work, they are not optimal. For better performance,
  try changing the Video Driver to OpenGL or XVideo and Sound Driver to OSS or
  ALSA.

* The following things don't work. They are just a reminder for me to do them
  one day:

  		1) Start Netplay
  		2) Start AVI Recording
  		3) Correct Aspect
  		4) Cheats
  		5) Control using Mouse

Thats all! Other things should be self-explainatory.


Intalling and Using Video Plugins
---------------------------------

All the video plugins should be installed in "~/.regen/plugins/" directory.
After installing, they will show up in "Video Plugins" sub menu.


Troubleshoothing and advanced settings
--------------------------------------

* Color of the text messages and FPS indicator can be changed by specifying the
  R, G and B components of your favourite colors in the TextColor_R,
  TextColor_G and TextColor_B respectively. Remember, the color format is 5-6-5.

* If the sound is crackling or lagging etc... try changing the
  "SoundBufferSize" setting in the config file. The value should be specified in
  milliseconds.

* By default, Regen/GTK+ will automatically try to use the appropriate sound
  device, but if you have something else or want to try some other setting, you
  can change the "SoundDevice" in the config file, to point to the device (e.g.
  /dev/audio) of your choice.

* Some games and hacks do things which result in the real hardware and Regen to
  lock-up. If you don't want this to happen, set the "EmulateLockups" setting
  in the config file to 0.

History
-------

Regen/GTK+ 0.95
---------------

* Completely new GTK+ based GUI front end with support for hardware accelerated
  video cards and many other things.

* Truck loads of other stuff. Too much to mention (read: pain in the ass to
  write) here.

* Massively updated core emulation. Previous Regen ports of linux used slightly
  out-dated emulation core compared to thier same versioned Windows couterparts.
  But not this one, it uses the same emulation core as that of Regen 0.95 for
  Windows. All in all, it means its more accurate than ever.
